        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I’m an aspiring web developer. I'm originally from the North East of
          Italy, a small town called
          <strong>Cividale del Friuli</strong> close to the border with
          Slovenia. The town was foundend by Jiulius Caesar the Roman Emperor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm Living in Dublin Ireland since 2009. I’ve been working in the
          Hospitality field for long time. Two years ago I started to learn
          Coding for a Career Change. I did one Year of College at the Dublin
          Institute of Design but I didn't like it at all because in College
          they do too much theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          I Keep studying by myself on Udemy and Scrimba and know I'm starting
          the Techdegree by Treehouse in Front End Development.

        <h2>Goals</h2>

          I really like coding and I would like to be a Front End Developer and

        <ul class="skills">

        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>
          I like very much Photography. The Photo of my hometown that is in the
          main page I took it myself. I think a good Photo is like a painting
          that can give some emotions to who is looking at. I love to Travel, I
          have been in many places in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently I was in Kiev(Ukraine) and Malaga(Spain). Outside Europe I
          was in San Diego California and in Brazil in two cities on the North
          East of the Country, named Recife and Fortaleza
        </p>
        <p>
          In May I will go to Valencia to take some sunshine, because in Ireland
          is not possible, and also to improve my Spanish because is a Language
          that I really Love. I speak 4 Languages: Italian, English, Brazilian
          Portuguese and Spanish.I like also Football, (American calls it
          "Soccer") and Italian food like Pizza and Ice-Cream.
