        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I’m an aspiring web developer. I'm originally from the North East of
          Italy, a small town called
          <strong>Cividale del Friuli</strong> close to the border with
          Slovenia. The town was foundend by Jiulius Caesar the Roman Emperor.

          I'm Living in Dublin Ireland since 2009. I’ve been working in the
          Hospitality field for long time. Two years ago I started to learn
          Coding for a Career Change. I did one Year of College in Dublin but I
          didn't like at all because in College they do too much theory.
        </p>

          I Keep studying by myself on Udemy and Scrimba and know I'm starting
          the Techdegree by Treehouse.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I really like coding and I would like to be a Front End Developer and
          increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:
        </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>CSS and JS Framework</li>
          <li>Version Control/Git</li>
          <li>Responsive Design</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>
          I’d like very much Photography. The Photo that is in the main page I
          took it myself. I think a good Photo is like a painting that can give
          some emotions to who is looking at. I like also Football and Italian
          food.
